In this project I use VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

The script loops through all the stocks for one year for each run and takes the following information.
  - The ticker symbol
  - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  - The total stock volume of the stock
  - The stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume". 

I use conditional formatting to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
